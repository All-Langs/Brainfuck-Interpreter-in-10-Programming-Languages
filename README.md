# What is Brainfuck
Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, and notable for its extreme minimalism.

The language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer. While it is fully Turing-complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers.

The language's name is a reference to the slang term brainfuck, which refers to things so complicated or unusual that they exceed the limits of one's understanding.

```
>	increment the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the right).
<	decrement the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the left).
+	increment (increase by one) the byte at the data pointer.
-	decrement (decrease by one) the byte at the data pointer.
.	output the byte at the data pointer.
,	accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer.
[	if the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching ] command.
]	if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching [ command.
